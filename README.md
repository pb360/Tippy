# Tip Calculator 

## *Your name here*

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [x] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [x] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount. 

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] Custom colors palette selected
* [x] List anything else that you did to improve the app functionality or design!
	* got hurt over the weekend but will update repo after due date with bill splitting functionality

## Notes

Overall a fun app to build. I had a knife go through my hand due to an awkward interaction with a friend while removing a pit from an avocado so i did not implement as much as planned. It set me back a bit to say the least... Avoid avacados and code, its dangerous out here.
